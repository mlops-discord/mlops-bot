Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm the bot for the MLOps Learning server. I just want to say hi and give you a quick tour.

We aim to create a community where everyone can feel comfortable asking questions and sharing their thoughts on various MLOps topics. No question is too basic!
We have members with diverse skills and experience levels. This includes ML developers at big and small corps, students, researchers, book authors, and startup founders. One of our missions is to connect people so that they can share their knowledge and learn together.
